            <h2>Melasma</h2>
            <p>Melasma is a skin condition characterized by brown or blue-gray patches or freckle-like spots. It's often
                called the “mask of pregnancy.” Melasma happens because of overproduction of the cells that make the
                color of your skin. It is common, harmless and some treatments may help.<a

            <h2>Acne</h2>
            <p>Acne is a skin condition that occurs when your hair follicles become plugged with oil and dead skin
                cells. It causes whiteheads, blackheads or pimples. Acne is most common among teenagers, though it
                affects people of all ages. Effective acne treatments are available, but acne can be persistent.<a

            <h2>Eczema</h2>
            <p>Many people use the word eczema when referring to atopic dermatitis, which is the most common type. The
                term atopic refers to a collection of conditions that involve the immune system, including atopic
                dermatitis, asthma, and hay fever. The word dermatitis refers to inflammation of the skin.<a

            <h2>Melanoma</h2>
            <p>Melanoma is a form of skin cancer that begins in the cells (melanocytes) that control the pigment in your
                skin. This illustration shows melanoma cells extending from the surface of the skin into the deeper skin
                layers.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/skin-cancer/melanoma" target="_parent">Read More</a>

            <h2>Cataract</h2>
            <p>When you have a cataract, light can't get through as easily. The result: You can't see as well and may
                notice glare or a halo around lights at night.

                Cataracts often form slowly. They don't cause symptoms like pain, redness, or tearing in the eye.

                Some stay small and don't affect your sight. If they do progress and affect your vision, surgery almost
                always works to bring it back.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/cataract" target="_parent">Read

            <h2>Eyestrain</h2>
            <p>Anyone who reads for hours, works at a computer, or drives long distances knows about this one. It
                happens when you overuse your eyes. They get tired and need to rest, just like any other part of your
                body.

                If your eyes feel strained, give them some time off.<a

            <h2>Lazy Eye</h2>
            <p>Lazy eye, or amblyopia, happens when one eye doesn’t develop properly. Vision is weaker in that eye, and
                it tends to move “lazily” around while the other eye stays put. It’s found in infants, children, and
                adults, and rarely affects both eyes. Treatment needs to be sought immediately for infants and
                children.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/lazy-eye" target="_parent">Read More</a></p>

            <h2>Presbyopia</h2>
            <p>This happens when you lose the ability, despite good distance vision, to clearly see close objects and
                small print.

                After age 40 or so, you may have to hold a book or other reading material farther away from your eyes to
                make it easier to read. Sort of like your arms are too short.<a

            <h2>Breast Cancer</h2>
            <p>Hormones that women have in their body -- estrogen and progesterone -- can be fuel for some types of
                breast cancer. They help the cells grow and spread. Hormone therapy, also called endocrine therapy,
                adds, blocks, or removes those chemicals to treat the disease.<a

            <h2>Lung Cancer</h2>
            <p>Two major types of lung cancer are non-small cell lung cancer and small cell lung cancer. Causes of lung
                cancer include smoking, second-hand smoke, exposure to certain toxins and family history.
                Symptoms include a cough (often with blood), chest pain, wheezing and weight loss. These symptoms often
                don't appear until the cancer is advanced.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/lung-cancer"

            <h2>Multiple Myeloma</h2>
            <p>Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells. Normal plasma cells are found in the bone marrow and are an
                important part of the immune system. The immune system is made up of several types of cells that work
                together to fight infections and other diseases.<a

            <h2>Prostate Cancer</h2>
            <p>A man's prostate produces the seminal fluid that nourishes and transports sperm.
                Symptoms include difficulty with urination, but sometimes there are no symptoms at all.
                Some types of prostate cancer grow slowly. In some of these cases, monitoring is recommended.<a

            <h2>Otitis externa</h2>
            <p>Otitis externa is an infection or inflammation of the ear canal between the eardrum and the outer ear. It
                can be triggered by exposure to dirty water or by mechanical damage due to overzealous cleaning. The
                infectious agent can be either fungal or bacterial.<a

            <h2>Otitis media</h2>
            <p>Otitis media is an infection of the middle ear, which can be either acute or chronic. Children are most
                commonly affected by acute otitis media because it is caused by colds and blocked Eustachian tubes –
                both typical ailments of childhood. The infectious agent can be either viral or bacterial, with research
                suggesting that viruses are responsible for most cases.<a

            <h2>Acute mastoiditis</h2>
            <p>The bone that can be felt immediately behind the ear is called the mastoid. Acute mastoiditis is
                infection of this bone, caused by prior acute otitis media. The symptoms include reddened and swollen
                skin over the mastoid, fever, discharge from the ear and intense pain.<a

            <h2>Infectious myringitis</h2>
            <p>Infectious myringitis is inflammation of the eardrum, caused by infection from either viruses or
                bacteria. The eardrum responds to the inflammation by forming small blisters. This can be quite painful.
                If fever is present, the infectious agent is almost certainly bacterial.<a

            <h2>Depression</h2>
            <p>Depression is characterized by sadness, loss of interest or pleasure, feelings of guilt or low
                self-worth, disturbed sleep or appetite, tiredness, and poor concentration. People with depression may
                also have multiple physical complaints with no apparent physical cause. Depression can be long-lasting
                or recurrent, substantially impairing people’s ability to function at work or school and to cope with
                daily life. At its most severe, depression can lead to suicide.<a

            <h2>Bipolar disorder</h2>
            <p>This disorder affects about 45 million people worldwide. It typically consists of both manic and
                depressive episodes separated by periods of normal mood. Manic episodes involve elevated or irritable
                mood, over-activity, rapid speech, inflated self-esteem and a decreased need for sleep. People who have
                manic attacks but do not experience depressive episodes are also classified as having bipolar
                disorder.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/bipolar-disorder" target="_parent">Read More</a></p>

            <h2>Dementia</h2>
            <p>Worldwide, approximately 50 million people have dementia. Dementia is usually of a chronic or progressive
                nature in which there is deterioration in cognitive function (i.e. the ability to process thought)
                beyond what might be expected from normal ageing. It affects memory, thinking, orientation,
                comprehension, calculation, learning capacity, language, and judgement. The impairment in cognitive
                function is commonly accompanied, and occasionally preceded, by deterioration in emotional control,
                social behaviour, or motivation.<a href="https://www.healthline.com/health/dementia"

            <h2>Developmental Coordination Disorders</h2>
            <p>DCD is a lack of coordination between your mental intentions and your ability to get your body to carry
                out those intentions. For example, you might think, “I need to tie my shoe.” However, your brain does
                not properly send the instructions for shoe tying to your hands and feet. Your brain knows how to tie
                shoes, but your hands just can’t follow your brain’s instructions. The same thing happens when you try
                to run, jump, write, button a shirt, and many other tasks that most people take for granted.<a
