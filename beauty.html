        <h1>Mascara</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>What to look when choosing Mascara</h2>
            <p>When it comes to choosing the best mascara for your lashes, there are many different factors to keep in
                mind: Will the mascara formula or bristles irritate sensitive eyes, smudge, flake, or clump? Is the
                mascara volumizing, does it lengthen, or claim to do both? Is it waterproof? There are a ton of options
                out there that claim to volumize and create the look of falsies sans fake lashes, but the best mascara
                will add length and volume without sacrificing your lashes’ health.

                We’ve written about many different types of mascara over the years, from ones we’ve rigorously tested
                for our Healthy Beauty Awards to recommendations we’ve sourced from professional makeup artists and
                beauty editors. Since we know that finding the perfect mascara can be a real headache, let us help you
                skip the trip to the drugstore to agonize over racks of products.

                There are many great buildable, thickening mascaras available at online retailers like Amazon, Sephora,
                Target, and Nordstrom from drugstore brands like Maybelline and L’Oréal Paris to luxury brands like Dior
                and Gucci.<a href="https://www.self.com/gallery/best-mascaras" target="_parent">Read More</a></p>

        <h1>Lip Products</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>What to Look for When Choosing Lip Products</h2>
            <p>Our winners were thoroughly reviewed by expert testers and chosen based on guidelines determined by
                dermatologists. You’ll notice many of them contain hydrating ingredients like hyaluronic acid and
                dimethicone—ingredients our derms recommend for adding moisture—and seal in moisture with hydrating oils
                like coconut oil and sunflower seed oil.

                You can think of your lips like sensitive skin: It’s important to keep them hydrated, as they can dry
                out and get irritated easily. For that reason, dermatologists recommend calming ingredients when
                possible, like glycerin, aloe, and ceramides.<a href="https://www.self.com/gallery/best-lip-cares"

        <h1>Base Makeup</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>What to Look for When Choosing Base Makeup Products</h2>
            <p>The right full-coverage makeup products for your skin depend on your goals with makeup (are you going all
                out or for a minimalist no-makeup vibe?) and your skin type. If your skin tends to be dry, it’s
                important to look for products that contain hydrating and moisturizing ingredients, such as hyaluronic
                acid, dimethicone, and certain oils. These products tend to have creamier textures.

                Those with oily or acne-prone skin will want to opt for products with lighter formulas, like lightweight
                liquids and powder products. They might find that heavier products with more moisturizing ingredients
                feel heavy or greasy on their skin and may even contribute to acne.

                And people with sensitive skin should pay attention to any ingredients that might irritate. The most
                common skin irritants in these types of products tend to be fragrance and essential oils. Some botanical
                extracts can also be irritating, but what causes issues for one person’s skin may not be problematic for
                others.<a href="https://www.self.com/gallery/best-foundations-concealers-full-coverage-makeup"

        <h1>Eyebrow Pencils</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>17 Eyebrow Pencils That Makeup Artists Swear By</h2>
            <p>When it comes to filling in and defining sparse brows, there are lots of products to choose from to get
                the job done. If you’re looking for a more natural, low-key look, a great eyebrow pencil might suit your
                makeup needs the best. It’s one of our all-time favorite methods for enhancing our brows, and also
                happens to be really simple to master. Although using a pencil with a spoolie (that spiral brush for
                combing hairs into place and shaping brows) to create a fuller look might seem a little intimidating at
                first, it can be a great way to help give your face a little extra definition.

                If you can use a traditional pen or pencil to write, we’re betting you can master filling in your brows
                with one of these. It’s a combination of the pencil’s formula and design, and executing a smooth
                technique. Since it can be easy to go from 0 to 100 with your brows when framing them—boxy brows are a
                definite no-no—we asked a few professional makeup artists about some of the best eyebrow pencils around
                to create natural-looking brows that still make an impact. Read on for their favorite eyebrow pencils
                (and pens), from top brands like Anastasia Beverly Hills and Fenty Beauty.<a

        <h1>Makeup Brushes</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>How to Deep-Clean Your Makeup Brushes</h2>
            <p>Cleaning makeup brushes is right up there with filing taxes and flossing on the checklist of items that
                we’d rather not do but know we should anyways. It’s tempting to just pick up yesterday’s foundation
                brush, keep on buffing powder with it, and reuse it for today’s makeup look—but for your own peace of
                mind, cleaning your makeup brushes is really, really, truly worth it for a variety of health reasons.

                “As makeup and oils build up on brushes and sponges, they create a breeding ground for bacteria and
                other microorganisms, which can cause breakouts, styes, staph, or even herpes outbreaks,”
                board-certified dermatologist Hadley King, M.D., tells SELF. “Using dirty makeup brushes and sponges can
                lead to not only skin irritation, but also potentially infections.” That’s not to mention the longevity
                of your brushes themselves. Gunk and buildup that gathers on dirty makeup brushes can also cause them to
                deteriorate more quickly, affecting your makeup application.<a

        <h1>Eyeblash Growth</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>Eyelash-Growth Serum: What Works, What Doesn’t</h2>
            <p>Eyelash-growth serum is one of those beauty products that seems too good to be true. Is it really
                possible to make your eyelashes grow thicker and longer, ostensibly removing your need for temporary
                lash-lengthening options, like mascara and false eyelashes?

                The beauty industry would have you believe that it is: Lately there has been an influx of eyelash-growth
                serums in stores that promise to strengthen and grow those tiny hairs. And you’ve probably seen the
                before-and-after pictures of women flaunting luscious lashes on Instagram and Amazon.

                But do these serums really work? And if they do, which is the best eyelash-growth serum out there? And
                is it safe to use so close to your precious eyes? We talked to the pros to find out.<a

        <h1>Nude Lipsticks</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>The Most Natural-Looking Nude Lipsticks</h2>
            <p>Although the idea might seem like a snooze-fest to some, a simple nude lipstick can be the cherry on top
                of a great makeup look. Since most nude lip shades are designed to resemble a person’s natural lip
                color, they’re ideal for wearing on an everyday basis, whether you’re pairing them with a smoldering
                smoky eye or opting for a clean, no-makeup-makeup look.

                As SELF previously reported, a nude can be several different shades depending on the skin tone, which is
                definitely true for women of color. Since we come in a wide variety of beautiful and highly melanated
                shades, it can be tricky to figure out which lipsticks will accent our skin tones instead of falling
                flat.

                To get a few steps closer to procuring a nude lipstick color that doesn’t make us look like we bit into
                a powdered donut, we got the inside scoop on some holy-grail favorites from fellow women of color. From
                spot-on nudes to some with pinker hues, read on for 19 natural-looking lipsticks that are must-haves in
                any makeup collection.<a href="https://www.self.com/gallery/nude-lipsticks-woc" target="_parent">Read

        <h1>Face Primers</h1>
        <div>
            <h2>9 Face Primers That Makeup Artists Swear By</h2>
            <p>After moisturizer and sunscreen, face primer is typically used as the first line of defense to keep your
                makeup look locked and loaded, without any smudging or slippage. “Makeup primers are a fantastic layer
                between your skin and your makeup,” makeup artist Angel Gabriel tells SELF. “When it comes to your
                foundation, [primers] can [help] make your skin more look radiant, fill in scars and blemishes, and keep
                your makeup long-lasting and fresh.”

                Don’t discount the importance of throwing a little primer on your eyelids, too. According to Gabriel,
                using an eye primer can intensify the pigmentation of shadows, and keep them from moving around and
                creasing (forming tiny lines in the product after it sets). A smooth eye base with a little hold can
                help make your cut crease or cat-eye last from the work day through happy hour, just like your favorite
                face primer.

                Since primers are such an important step in a makeup routine, we went straight to the pros to find out
                which ones they swear by. From brands like Becca and Dermalogica, here are the effective primers that
                five makeup artists always keep in their bags to create a makeup masterpiece that stays in place.<a
